[GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/fb-javascript) - You will need to be added as a contributor, so give your gitlab username in the slack group.

# Contributing

## How ?

If you want to contribute to these documents, you need access to this repository [topicify-docs](https://gitlab.com/fb-javascript/topicify-docs). See the GitLab repo link above, and gain access through the slack group. Make sure to join the [#javascript-project-artificial-intelligence](https://app.slack.com/client/TPS1679UG/CPFPHAM2P) slack channel.

Once you have access to this repository, you will want to clone it to your local computer and follow the instructions in the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/fb-javascript/topicify-docs/blob/master/README.md) at the root directory of this project to get it running on http://localhost:3000. Then you can edit any of these "Markdown" files (.md) in the /docs folder, create new .md files, and edit the files in /website.
You can then commit your code and push it. It should then automatically build and deploy to [topicify-docs.now.sh](https://topicify-docs.now.sh) where you can see your live changes.

Please create branches outside of master, and when you are happy with your commits and edits/additions on your localhost, then merge them into master. This should help reduce silly mistakes and bugs from reaching the live docs.

## What?

This documentation will be where the project can be specified and planned to make it easier for future contributors to join in. Eventually documentation on code and implementations may be created. This place will store whatever documentation that developers / maintainers think makes sense to write and store.

It is currently pretty void of content, so please start editing it; add anything you think is relevant!

- Break the project description (see Overview) down into small parts and those into smaller parts.
- Suggest technical solutions, tools, languages, draw diagrams, make high-level architectural plans..
- Clean up the documentation / this website, so it looks a bit nicer, create a logo. Add / begin all relevant sections / documentation you think may be needed.
- You could create a meta.md which is where we discuss how the documentation should be layed out, what sections should be where etc.

## Why?

- To learn
- For fun / to enjoy
- A useful application at the end of it
- It can help you finding a job as you would have a team-project you worked on
